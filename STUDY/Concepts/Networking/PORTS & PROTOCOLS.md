## Essential Networking Ports & Protocols for SOC Analysts

Understanding the purpose of different network ports and their associated protocols is a critical skill for any SOC analyst. Abnormal traffic on these ports can often be the first indicator of reconnaissance, an intrusion attempt, or an active compromise. This table provides an expanded reference for the common and less-common ports that L1 and L2 analysts should be familiar with.
