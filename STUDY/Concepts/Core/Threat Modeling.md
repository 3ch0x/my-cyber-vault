**Threat Modeling** is the process of using hypothetical scenarios, system diagrams and testing to help secure systems and data. We use threat modeling to improve cyber-security and trust in key business systems by identifying vulnerabilities, helping with risk assessment and suggesting corrective action. 
#### Why we need threat modeling ?

As organizations become more digital and cloud based, IT systems face increased risk and vulnerability. Growing use of mobile and internet of things (IOT)  also increase threat landscape. Threat modeling enables organizations to systematically identify, evaluate and prioritize security threats before they become real issues. 
###### Some key reasons 
1. Proactive risk identification
2. Reducing the attack surface 
3. Prioritizing security needs
4. Enhancing collaboration
5. Cost efficiency
6. Improve compliance
7. Continuous adaptation
8. Building security into system design

#### The Foundational "Four Questions" Framework

1. **What are we working on?** (System modeling, scope definition)
2.  **What can go wrong?** (Threat identification)
3. **What are we going to do about it?** (Mitigation and risk response)
4. **Did we do a good enough job?** (Review, validation, and continuous improvement)
